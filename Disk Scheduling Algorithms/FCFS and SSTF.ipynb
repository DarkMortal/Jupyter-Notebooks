    "# Theory\n",
    "## FCFS\n",
    "- FCFS stands for First Come First Served.\n",
    "- As the name suggests, this algorithm entertains requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue.\n",
    "- It is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm.\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- It is simple, easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "- It does not cause starvation to any request.\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- It results in increased total seek time.\n",
    "- It is inefficient.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## SSTF\n",
    "- SSTF stands for Shortest Seek Time First.\n",
    "- This algorithm services that request next which requires least number of head movements from its current position regardless of the direction.\n",
    "- It breaks the tie in the direction of head movement.\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- It reduces the total seek time as compared to FCFS.\n",
    "- It provides increased throughput.\n",
    "- It provides less average response time and waiting time.\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- There is an overhead of finding out the closest request.\n",
    "- The requests which are far from the head might starve for the CPU.\n",
    "- It provides high variance in response time and waiting time.\n",
    "- Switching the direction of head frequently slows down the algorithm.\n",
