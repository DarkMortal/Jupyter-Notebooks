    "\n",
    "Huffman encoding is a classical lossless data compression algorithm designed to reduce the size of data without losing any information. Its fundamental idea is to represent each symbol (such as a character in a text file) with a unique variable-length binary code, where the *most frequent symbols* are assigned the **shortest codes** and the *least frequent symbols* get **longer codes**. This efficiently reduces the total number of bits needed to encode a message, especially in data where some symbols appear much more often than others.\n",

    "### 1. Create Node Classes for Huffman Tree\n",
    "- Each node has a character and its frequency.\n",
    "- The node may point to a left and right child node.\n",
    "- Operator overloading (__lt__, __gt__, __eq__) is used for maintaining node ordering in a heap (priority queue).\n",
    "### 2. Populate a Min-Heap of Leaf Nodes\n",
    "- For every unique character, create a node with its frequency.\n",
    "- Push all nodes into a min-heap, so nodes with the lowest frequency have the highest priority.\n",
    "### 3. Build the Huffman Tree\n",
    "- While there are more than one nodes in the heap:\n",
    "    - Extract the two nodes with the lowest frequency.\n",
    "    - Create a new internal node whose frequency is the sum of the two extracted nodes.\n",
    "    - Set the two extracted nodes as the left and right children of the new node.\n",
    "    - Insert the new node back into the min-heap.\n",
    "- After the loop, the heap contains only one nodeâ€”the root of the Huffman Tree.\n",
    "### 4. Traverse the Huffman Tree to Assign Codewords\n",
    "- Start from the root node.\n",
    "- Traverse left by appending '0' to the codeword, and right by appending '1'.\n",
    "- When a leaf node is reached (character node), assign the accumulated binary codeword to that character.\n",
    "- This is commonly implemented as a recursive preorder traversal.\n",
    "### 5. Store and Return the Encodings\n",
    "- Store all character-to-codeword mappings in a dictionary (charMap).\n",
    "- Return this mapping as the result.\n",
